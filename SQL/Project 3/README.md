## Introduction
This data analysis project aims to explore and gain insights from a dataset provided by a global retail company. The dataset contains various columns such as order details, customer information, product information, and financial metrics. By utilizing PostgreSQL, we can perform advanced data analysis and address key business questions related to sales performance and customer segmentation.

### Target Audience
This project is geared towards data analysts, business intelligence professionals, retail managers, and executives who are interested in conducting in-depth analysis to gain insights into sales performance and customer segmentation within a global retail company. It is also relevant for marketing professionals seeking to understand customer behavior and make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.

### Questions to be Answered
1. What is the overall sales performance of the global retail company?
2. Which product categories and sub-categories generate the highest sales?
3. How do sales vary across different regions and markets?
4. What are the trends in sales over time? Are there any seasonal patterns?
5. How does the order priority impact sales and profitability?
6. Can we identify customer segments based on their purchasing behavior?
7. Which customers contribute the most to sales and profit?
8. How does the shipping cost affect profitability?
9. Are there any correlations between discounts, quantity, and profitability?
