# Exploring Employee Data

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to perform data analysis on a dataset containing employee information. By utilizing SQL queries, we aim to gain insights into various aspects of the employees' demographics, employment history, and termination details. This analysis can provide valuable information to human resources departments, management teams, or any stakeholders interested in understanding the composition and dynamics of the employee workforce.

## Target Audience
Human resources departments, management teams, and stakeholders interested in analyzing employee data.

## Questions to Explore:
1. What is the distribution of employees across different cities, departments, and job titles?
2. What is the overall gender ratio in the workforce?
3. What is the average age and length of service for employees? Is there any correlation between age and length of service?
4. Which employees have the longest and shortest tenure in the company?
5. How many employees were terminated in each year? What are the most common termination reasons and types?
6. How does employee turnover vary across different departments or business units?
7. Are there any relationships between employee attributes such as age, gender, or job title, and the termination reason or type?
8. Are there any patterns in the hiring trends based on store numbers or years?
