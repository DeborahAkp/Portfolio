                <h1><b> About Me</b></h1>
                <p>I am an aspiring self-taught data analyst with proficiency in Python, JavaScript, Excel, and SQL. My
                    passion for
                    data
                    analysis started as a hobby and has now turned into a career aspiration. Currently, I am working as
                    an
                    Office Support Assistant at MDOS Consulting, where I manage contracts and collaborate with team
                    members
                    to
                    create and submit successful Request for Proposals responses.

                    <br>
                    Prior to my current role, I worked as a Junior Medical Writer/Researcher and Drug Editor/Reviewer at
                    Thera-Business, where I summarized clinical study results, appraised studies for data contribution,
                    and
                    maintained the drug database using Microsoft Excel. I have also worked as a Client Care Coordinator
                    at
                    CBI
                    Home Health, where I used scheduling software to fulfill patients' care plans, managed client
                    profiles,
                    and
                    communicated with care providers to ensure schedules were carried out effectively and efficiently.

                    <br>
                    My experience in these roles has equipped me with excellent organizational and communication skills,
                    attention to detail, and a strong work ethic. I am eager to continue developing my skills in data
                    analysis
                    and work towards becoming a successful data analyst.
